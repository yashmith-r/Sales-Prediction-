# Sales Prediction Case Project

## Project Overview

This case project centers on predicting sales based on various advertising expenditures. The project involves preprocessing the dataset, exploring data characteristics, and evaluating the effectiveness of different regression models. Key tasks include data normalization, model training, and performance comparison.

## Key Learnings

- **Handling Missing Values:** Identified and managed missing data to ensure a clean dataset.
- **Data Normalization:** Applied normalization techniques to standardize data and improve model accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation:** Compared the performance of Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression (SVR) using metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-squared.
- **Visualization Insights:** Created visualizations to compare model performances and understand the impact of different features on sales predictions.

## Experience Gained

- **Regression Analysis:** Gained experience in applying and interpreting results from Linear Regression and SVR models.
- **Performance Metrics:** Utilized various metrics to evaluate model accuracy and effectiveness.
- **Model Comparison:** Analyzed how different regression techniques perform on sales prediction tasks and assessed their strengths and weaknesses.
