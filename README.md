# Sales Prediction Case Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing advertising expenditures (TV, Radio, Newspaper) to predict sales. The work includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model evaluation, and predicting sales based on new advertising budgets.

## Key Learnings

- **Handling Missing Values:** Identified and addressed missing data, applying imputation or exclusion based on the nature of missingness.
- **Normalization:** Applied Min-Max normalization to improve model performance.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Analyzed relationships between advertising expenditures and sales to determine their impact.
- **Model Comparison:** Compared Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression (SVR) using evaluation metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-squared.
- **Visualization:** Created plots to visualize regression lines and model predictions.

## Experience Gained

- **Data Cleaning:** Techniques for handling missing values and normalizing data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Insights from correlation analysis and data visualization.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessment and comparison of regression models' performance.

## Analysis Highlights

1. **Impact of Advertising Mediums:** Identified which advertising medium has the highest impact on sales.
2. **Regression Line Visualization:** Plotted a linear regression line including all variables (TV, Radio, Newspaper) to predict sales and visualized model predictions.
3. **Normalization Impact:** Compared the performance of the linear regression model before and after normalization.
